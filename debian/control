Description: perl module to create bubble-babble fingerprints
 Digest::BubbleBabble takes a message digest (generated by
 either of the MD5 or SHA-1 message digest algorithms) and creates
 a fingerprint of that digest in "bubble babble" format.
 Bubble babble is a method of representing a message digest
 as a string of "real" words, to make the fingerprint easier
 to remember. The "words" are not necessarily real words, but
 they look more like words than a string of hex characters.
 .
 Bubble babble fingerprinting is used by the SSH2 suite
 (and, consequently, by Net::SSH::Perl, the Perl SSH
 implementation) to display easy-to-remember key fingerprints.
 The key (a DSA or RSA key) is converted into a textual form,
 digested using Digest::SHA, and run through bubblebabble
 to create the key fingerprint.
